# Py2C

Py2C is a mini Python-to-C optimizer designed to explore how high-level
numerical Python code can be transformed into efficient low-level C code.

The project is built from first principles and focuses on compiler
concepts such as abstract syntax trees, intermediate representations,
optimization passes, and code generation.

## Scope

Current scope (implemented incrementally):
- Numeric variables and arithmetic
- For-loops with range
- Assignment statements
- Basic expressions

Planned extensions:
- Functions
- Conditional control flow
- More aggressive optimizations

## Motivation

Py2C is a learning-oriented compiler project intended to make core
compiler and static analysis concepts tangible through implementation.

## Status

Project under active development.
